Slush generator (J)ade (ug)lify (s)tylus makes development fun again!

- **Browser Sync** : *Live reloading system*
- **Babel** : *ES.Next to ES5 compiler formerly called 6to5*
- **Jshint** : *Lint your javascript in its ES.Next format*
- **Jade** : *Templating system made easy*
- **Stylus** : *Powerful CSS Preprocessor with a beautiful syntax*
  - **Nib** : **[optional]** *Choosing this plugin on init gives you plenty of extensions*
  - **Kouto Swiss** : **[optional]** *Alternative plugin that gives tons of additional features*
- **Uglify** : *Both CSS and JS to make your client payloads small and quick to load*

## Installation

Simply install [slush][2], as well as this generator globally:

```
npm install -g slush slush-jugs
mkdir appName
cd appName
slush jugs
```

to run...

```
gulp
```

And just like that, you're on the way to making your app!

## File Structure

No files are concatenated together, use includes in your jade files and
imports in your stylus files. If you're hoping to use a modular system in
your javascript then use the "slush-justice" generator instead.

## Notes

The boilerplate comes setup with the perspective of a video game developer, but
can be easily transitioned into other avenues. Two very basic libraries are included
that I developed : Easel and Ion.

Easel sets up a canvas that will fit the perspective of the window
and automatically adjust in size when the window is resized. It's an extremely small
library and sets up a few variables that I find very useful:

* **ctx** : *context of the canvas*
* **v.w** : *viewport width in pixels*
* **v.h** : *viewport height in pixels*
* **r(number)** : *returns a decimal between 0 and number*
* **r(number,0,1)** : *returns an integer between 0 and number*
* **r(num1,num2)** : *returns a decimal between num1 and num2*
* **r(num1,num2,1)** : *returns an integer between num1 and num2*
* **Easel.background** : *color to flood the canvas with when it redraws*
* **Easel.redraw()** : *override this function to handle redraws on resize, or call it by hand*

Ion is an extremely lightweight particle engine made for canvas 2d context. The
library is well-documented.

## Thanks

This boilerplate of mine is just a combination of great tools, all credit goes to
those who actually put in all the hard work to create them.

- The [Gulp][1] developers. Streaming build system - how nice and easy it is to setup.
- There have been many [Slush][2] generators that have been instrumental in getting
  all those pesky apps developed on time. It's great to finally have an alternative
  to Yeoman.
- Though [Jade][3] has been seen predominately as a server-side helper for templating,
  I find it incredibly helpful on front-end projects where I'm using a build system
  anyways, as the syntax is far easier to read and reduces duplication of segments with
  partials.
- From css to less to sass to [Stylus][4], it's been a long road with css pre-processors,
  but I finally found one that lets me drop all the redundant syntax and focus more on the
  design. I love my curly brace languages, but personally think that it gets in-between
  me and focusing on what's important when dealing with UX, wireframing or general
  design.
- Lately I've taken the plunge into [Kouto Swiss][5] from [Nib][6], though the latter
  clear influenced the former. Without sass, it was a lonely road not being able to use
  bourban or compass, or hat with less. [Kouto Swiss][5] has added many features I haven't
  seen in other plugins before, it's a welcome addition to my toolkit.
- If you're still coding without a linter like [JSHint][7], I'm not sure whether to
  give you a high-five for all the hard work or question your dedication for only
  stupidity.
- Dropped Traceur for [Babel][8] (formerly 6to5) because it has more readable compiled
  code. You can gather more specifics on comparisons of the two at their website.
